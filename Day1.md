Went over the basics of Swift

Topics covered were:

1. Variables
var hello = "Hello World!"

2. Strings and Integers

var favoriteColor = "Green"
var age = 30
var population = 8_000_000 # Can use underscore for readiblity of large numbers

3. Multi-line Strings
var learn = """
This is 
a multi line
sentence
"""

var str2 = """
This goes \
over multiple \
lines
"""

4. Doubles and booleans
var cantHandle = true;
var pi = 3.14 

5. String Interpolation
var score = 85
var str = "Your score was \(score)"

6. Constants 
let taylor = "swift" # Let means it cant be changed 

7. Type annotations
let album: String = "Reputation"
let year: Int = 1989
let height: Double = 1.78
let taylorRocks: Bool = true
